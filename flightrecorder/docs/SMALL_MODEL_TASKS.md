# Small-model task queue

These tasks are intentionally narrow. Each task should be doable by a smaller
model without broad architecture decisions. Do one task at a time, keep edits
inside the listed files, and run the smoke test before handing back.

Do not change prompts, public Hugo output, API shapes, sqlite schema, or
publisher redaction behavior unless the task explicitly says so.

## Completed ledger

The following small-model tasks are done and should not be repeated unless a
regression is found:

## Active queue

Pick from the top unless Daniel or the senior agent says otherwise.

## S111 - Project registry loader

Where:
- `flightrecorder/src/backend/flightrecorder/project_registry.py`
- `flightrecorder/tests/unit/test_project_registry.py`
- `flightrecorder/tests/smoke/smoke_project_registry.py`

What:
- Implement a typed project registry loader for runtime `projects.json`.
- Use dataclasses and type hints.
- Accept a JSON array of project objects with `name`, `ref`, `path`, and
  `active`; optional fields may be preserved if already in the fixture.
- Validate refs with the same conservative slug rules used elsewhere.
- Return only active projects from a helper such as `active_projects()`.
- Add unit tests using `tests/fixtures/project_registry/projects.json`.
- Add a smoke script that loads the fixture and prints active refs.
- Do not add API routes and do not touch schema.

Why:
- This is real build-order step 15 groundwork. Idea capture and matchmaker need
  a shared project reference source instead of ad hoc strings.

Smoke test:

```sh
cd /home/daniel/Documents/Projekter/Daniel90mm.github.io/flightrecorder
.venv/bin/python -m pytest tests/unit/test_project_registry.py -q
.venv/bin/python tests/smoke/smoke_project_registry.py
```
